- Having a big dick. It might give you confidence, but no one really likes it when you take it out and swing it around.

- Being grateful that the M snuck into STEM. Because you know we operate more like humanities departments than labs even if the grant makers don't.

- Stumbling over the pronunciation of that typesetting language you use everyday and forgetting the difference between "this" and "that".

- Constantly offending someone for either talking down to them or over their head because it is impossible to mindread precisely what they need.

- Defining the things you need to do your job. It's really the best. <3
