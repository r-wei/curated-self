<div class="post">
	I am a data scientist, mathematician, and 2nd-generation tech worker.

<h2 class="post-title">Machine Learning</h2>
<div class="post">
	<p>Currently, I design on NLP models to respect privacy, require less labeled training data, generalize well within a given subject area, and actively learn.</p>
	<p>In the past, I've built:
	<ul>
		<li>computer-vision models to estimate vehicle damage for an insurance company</li>
		<li>statistical models to test for discrimination in police activity</li>
		<li>NLP tools to organize documents for journalists and activists</li>
	</ul>

<h2 class="post-title">Tech Culture</h2>
<div class="post">
	<p>I have the privilege of being a second-generation tech worker. My mom was a software engineer for over 30 years. She wrote in C before C++ was standardized, and started her own company to make phone calls over in the Internet in the 1990s. I'm excited to share some of her stories on this blog as we talk about how tech has changed, accessibility and labor relations in the tech industry.</p>

<h2 class="post-title">Mathematics</h2>
<div class="post">
	<p>Math is my love language. I wrote my <a href="https://github.com/r-wei/thesis/blob/master/thesis_v2.pdf">doctoral dissertation</a> advised by Boris Tsygan in non-commutative algebra.</p>
