# curated-self

Code for Rebecca BurWei's Curated Self blog.

## Neat Features
My first Jekyll site! Here are some cute tricks I've implemented:
* Taglines in the left panel are [randomly chosen](https://github.com/rebecca-burwei/curated-self/blob/master/_layouts/default.html#L12-L20).
* The Site Last Updated date is [generated by the last build time](https://github.com/rebecca-burwei/curated-self/blob/master/_layouts/default.html#L31).
* Twitter metadata tags are generated even though [I'm not on Twitter](https://github.com/rebecca-burwei/curated-self/blob/master/_config.yml#L18).
* [A "low-tech" way](https://github.com/rebecca-burwei/curated-self/blob/master/_layouts/post.html#L23-L42) for blog readers to leave moderated, thoughtful comments without plugins or third-party providers.
