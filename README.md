# curated-self

Code for Rebecca BurWei's Curated Self blog.

## Neat Features
My first Jekyll site! Here are some cute tricks I've implemented:
* Taglines in the left panel are [randomly chosen](https://github.com/r-wei/curated-self/_layouts/default.html#L12-L20).
* The Site Last Updated date is [generated by the last build time](https://github.com/r-wei/curated-self/_layouts/default.html#L31).
* Twitter metadata tags are generated even though [I'm not on Twitter](https://github.com/r-wei/curated-self/_config.yml#L22).

## Code Base
The majority of this code is adapated from the [plainwhite](https://github.com/thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll) theme. In compliance with plainwhite's license, their [license and copyright](https://github.com/r-wei/curated-self/LICENSE-plainwhite.txt) are included in this repository.
